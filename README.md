# AutomatedLab-for-Pentesting
A script so setup a Windows lab for following through my series of blog posts about the classic attack vectory in pentesting. The Blogpost series covers the following attacks:

* Responder/Relay Attack and mitigations
* Kerberoasting
* Cracking NTLMv2 hashes with Hashcat with the use of better wordlists and masks as "hybrid" attack
* Obtaining NTLMv1 hashes with attack types like "dcsync" from Memory with Mimikatz and cracking them
* Relaying Tickets (pass the hash) with Mimikatz as well as the "golden ticket" attack

For the Script you will need the AutomatedLab Binary that you can find in the AutomatedLab Github Repository: https://github.com/AutomatedLab/AutomatedLab/releases
