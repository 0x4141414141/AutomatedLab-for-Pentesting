# AutomatedLab-for-Pentesting
A script to setup a Windows lab for pentesting that tries to fix the "works-on-my-machine" problem, which is based on the AutomatedLab project. 
If you have ever read a blog post about an attack and wondered why it is not working with your setup you know that problem. As our time is limited and pentesters like to penstest instead of administrating Windows environments this should help you spending more time doing the interesting things. :)

The blog post series is about the classic attack vectors in pentesting:

* Responder/Relay Attack and mitigations
* Kerberoasting
* Cracking NTLMv2 hashes with Hashcat with the use of better wordlists and masks as "hybrid" attack
* Obtaining NTLMv1 hashes with attack types like "dcsync" from Memory with Mimikatz and cracking them
* Relaying Tickets (pass the hash) with Mimikatz as well as the "golden ticket" attack

For the Script you will need the AutomatedLab Binary that you can find in the AutomatedLab Github Repository: https://github.com/AutomatedLab/AutomatedLab/releases
